# JavaCoffeeShopProject


In my MIST4600 Class (learning Java Development), I learned how to:

Effectively use an IDE (I learned Eclipse in class and extended to VScode for personal preference)
Declare, assign, manipulate, and retrieve data stored in variables and constants
Design and interpret programs that use the three control structures of modern computer programming: Sequence, Selection (decision statements), and Repetition (loops)
Understand classes, objects, and methods and how they can be used to implement solutions to problems
Store and retrieve data from various collection types (arrays, lists)
Demonstrate abilities to test and debug a program by finding and fixing syntax and logical errors
Develop and implement solutions for solving a problem so that it runs effectively and efficiently

This project, an example of a Coffee Shop GUI with 4 end-to-end processes and cross-linked functions, is the culmination of Java principles covered in class.
As an Honors student, I was able to get credit for increased intensity. This was taking on the two extra end-to-end processes while also demonstrating diagraphs
and data tables that are not included here, in the code.
